        "desc":"Polymer embraces encapsulated Custom Elements as its main organizing unit.  This simple-sounding concept is actually an incredibly powerful tool that can revolutionize how you think about solving complex problems, collaborate within large teams, reduce technology lock-in, and of course, build amazing apps for the web.  Hear how we think about building apps using custom elements directly from one of the Polymer core team engineers, and how to best employ this simple concept for the most leverage in your own projects."

How do you handle user authentication? What are the patterns that make up a good Polymer app? In this session I'll answer these questions, and guide you through the process of building an awesome offline-first Progressive webapp using Polymer Starter Kit, the Platinum elements, and Firebase."

        "desc":"Traditionally, CSS stylesheets have a terrible opinion about style encapsulation: the only thing stopping one element’s style from stomping over another’s is a “well chosen class name”. The Shadow DOM fixes this by building a little castle and a moat around each element, so that styles can’t get in and out of the web component castle. But what happens if you _do_ want to style this custom element? How do you cross the moat? Custom properties, that’s how."

A well crafted site is usable whether or not a person can see, use a mouse, or distinguish red from green - to mention just a few of the assumptions we inadvertently make. Come and learn about how and why we hold the Polymer 1.0 widget set to a high bar for accessibility, and how you can use the Polymer libraries to create your own accessible custom elements."

Web components allow us to componentize the web's best practices but that doesn't mean footguns are a thing of the past. In this talk, we'll cover tips and tricks for building fast Polymer apps right from the start."

In this session Paul Irish will show how the Chrome DevTools can help you understand where time is spent in your app and effective means of profiling your performance. You'll walk away with a solid understanding of how your polymer work can be as fast-loading and responsive-to-the-touch as you like."
